## Task 5 - What happened on September 1752 ?

**Answer -** The British Calendar Act of 1751 proclaimed that in Britain (and American Colonies) Thursday 3 September 1752 should become Thursday 14 September 1752.

Up until 1753, the calendar we used in Britain was the Julian Calendar. It was 365.25 days long, which was fractionally too long, and the calendar over time fell out of line with the seasons and thus was less accurate than the Gregorian Calendar.

This means that the year corresponds closely with the astronomical year (365.24219 days) so that it is just one day out every 3,300 years.

In 1752 Britain decided to abandon the Julian calendar in favour of the Gregorian. By doing so, 3 September instantly became 14 September - and as a result, nothing whatsoever happened in British history between 3 and 13 September 1752.
